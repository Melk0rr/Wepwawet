        Args:
            address (Union[str, IPv4]): The network address in string format or an IPv4 object representing the base IP address of the subnet.
            name (str): A descriptive name for the subnet.
            mask (Union[int, str, IPv4Mask], optional): The subnet mask. Can be provided as a CIDR notation string, an integer representing the number of leading 1-bits in the netmask, or a custom IPv4Mask object. If not provided, it will be determined from the address if possible (e.g., "192.168.1.0/24").
            description (str, optional): A brief description of the subnet, useful for administrative notes.
            hosts (Union[List[IPv4], List[str]], optional): An optional list of IP addresses or strings representing host IPs that are part of this subnet. Each element can be an IPv4 object or a string representation of an IP address.

        Attributes:
            mask (IPv4Mask) : The netmask associated with the subnet, which is derived from the provided address and mask parameters. If not explicitly set during initialization, it will be determined based on the network prefix length implied by the given address.
            address (IPv4)  : The base IP address of the subnet after applying any provided mask.
            broadcast (IPv4): The calculated broadcast address for this subnet. This is derived from the network address and the netmask.
            name (str)      : A user-defined name or identifier for the subnet.
            description (str, optional): A textual description associated with the subnet; can be used to provide details such as purpose, location, etc.
            hosts (dict)    : A dictionary where keys are host IP addresses and values could represent various attributes of these hosts in the network like MAC address or hostname. This is initially an empty dict that will store host information if provided during initialization.
